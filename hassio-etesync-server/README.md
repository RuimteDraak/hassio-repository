# **DEPRECATED** hassio-etesync-server

**DEPRECATED**
EteSync has updated to EteBase, version 2 of the EteSync server that allows for a lot more flexibility in the future. Unfortunealty the new version is not compatible with this old version. If you want to continue using EteSync as an home assistant addon, take a look at [the new EteBase addon in this repository](https://github.com/RuimteDraak/hassio-repository). This addon will no longer recieve any updates. 

For more information about migrating you account data, see [the release blogpost](https://blog.etesync.com/etesync-2-0-is-now-released/).
